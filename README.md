# Accelerate v1.0
## MyEAN boilerplate using angular-cli
A MySQL, Express, Angular and Node implementation for developers in a hurry.

## Prerequisites
1) Node, Express, MySQL Database and angular-cli
2) ng2-file-upload (https://github.com/valor-software/ng2-file-upload)
3) Your ideas, i.e. table schemas, column names, etc.


## FAQ
1) What the hell is this?
>It's a `set of codes`/`program` which will generate generic MVC models
for both the front-end and ~~backside~~ back-end of your system.

2) Who can use this?
>Accelerate was designed for both end-users and developers in mind.
It was built for ~~desperate students~~ developers off the shelf but with a little 
bit of ~~twerking~~ tweaking it can also serve as an end-user system.

3) Can I use this if I have absolutely no clue about Javascript/Typescript?
>Yes you can, **[tutorials coming soon - refer to bottom of page for more info]** 
but with limited customizations. Nobody can fly to the moon without learning how 
to control the spaceship so if you were expecting something of that sort, perhaps 
consider hiring some developers.

4) What if I run into trouble and it doesn't compile?
 > ~~If you are a female~~ Contact me via email. You just got to have faith 
 that I am decent enough to reply.
