# Accelerate v1.0
## MyEAN boilerplate with angular-cli
A MySQL, Express, Angular 4 and Node implementation for developers in a hurry.

## Prerequisites
1) Node, Express, MySQL Database and angular-cli
2) ng2-file-upload (https://github.com/valor-software/ng2-file-upload)
3) Your ideas, i.e. table schemas, column names, etc.

## Experience level required
- [x] Can setup and install MySQL Database, Node, Express and angular-cli
- [x] Javascript and Typescript literacy is preferable

## Getting Started
### The Database-Node-Express Back-end
1) Install MySQL Database with user access, Node, Express and angular cli.
2) Download the Accelerate v1.0 repository. The system consists of 2 parts.
   The "Node" folder runs the back-end processes while the "Angular" folder 
   contains segments of the front-end MVC models.
3) Edit the configuration file for accelerate which can be found at
   `./Node/app/settings.js`.
   

## FAQ
1) What the hell is this?
>It's a `program` which will generate generic MVC models
for both the front-end and ~~backside~~ back-end of your system.


2) Who can use this?
>Accelerate was designed for both end-users and developers in mind.
It was built for ~~desperate students~~ developers off the shelf but with a little 
bit of ~~twerking~~ tweaking it can also serve as an end-user system.


3) Can I use this if I have absolutely no clue about Javascript/Typescript?
>Yes you can, **[tutorials coming soon - refer to bottom of page for more info]** 
but with limited customizations. Nobody can fly to the moon without learning how 
to control the spaceship so if you were expecting something of that sort, perhaps 
consider hiring some developers.


4) What if I run into trouble and it doesn't compile?
 > ~~If you are a female~~ Contact me via email. You just got to have faith 
 that I am decent enough to reply.
